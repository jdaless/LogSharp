# LogSharp
Logical Programming in .NET

Still definitely a work in progress, but the goal is to have a .NET Standard library to have Prolog-like functionality.

## Setup

Do you have dotnet? [Get it.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)


```
$ git clone https://github.com/jdaless/LogSharp.git
$ cd LogSharp/
$ dotnet build
$ dotnet test
```

A lot of the tests will fail, they're just there to measure progress.
